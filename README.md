# Description
It does what the title says it does! Play the piano
and become the entertainer of the saloons. When you
walk up to the piano, you can use space to start
playing. If you want to stop, you simply hit F.
If you couldn't in real life, now you can in RedM!

---
# Features
- Customizable Config.
- Ability to add or remove pianos.

---
# Disclaimer
I have added 6 pianos to the script, these are the
most used saloon places. If you want to add more
pianos on the list, then keep in mind that now all
pianos work! This has to do with the seat in front
of it. Small round seats can be used, while chairs
can't. This is also the final version! It could be
that I change a little here and there, but don't
expect much more made in this script. I would not
know what to put extra in it. If you have any ideas
for a future update, feel free to contact me.
